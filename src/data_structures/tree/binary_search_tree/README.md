# Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

+ The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys smaller than the node's key
+ The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than node's key
+ You can't duplicate the node's key value
