# Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

+ The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys smaller than the node's key
+ The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than node's key
+ You can't duplicate the node's key value

In a binary tree? a node can have maximum two children.

## The main operations in binary tree:

* Search 
* Insert
* Delete 
* Pre-order Traversal 
* In-order Traversal
* Post-order Traversal

Time complexity in big O notation:

| Algorithm | Average  | Worst case |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Search    | O(log n) | O(n)       |
| Insert    | O(log n) | O(n)       |
| Delete    | O(log n) | O(n)       |
