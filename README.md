# Algorithms and data structures
Algorithms and data structures implemented in C++ with explanations.

## Data structures

### What is a Data Structure? 

A data structure (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

### Why Data Structures?
* They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
* They help to manage and organize data.
* They make code cleaner and easier to understand.

### Abstruct Data Types
An abstruct data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

### Time/Space Complexity

#### Big-O Notation
Big-O Notation gives an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case, helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes arbitrarily large.

<p>n - The size of the input<br>
Complexities ordered in from smallest to largest</p>

* Constant Time: O(1)
* Logarithmic Time: O(log (n))
* Linear Time: O(n)
* Linearithmic Time: O(n log(n))
* Quadric Time: O(n^2)
* Cubic Time: O(n^3)
* Exponential Time: O(b^n), b > 1
* Factorial Time: O(n!)

#### Big-O Properties
<p>O(n + c) = O(n) </br>
O(c n) = O(n), c > 0 </p>
